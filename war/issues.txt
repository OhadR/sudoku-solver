bug fixes:

1. 	nextToInsert: i dont do "+1" anymore, coz in case the next one allready filled, i get stuck.
 	so i wrote a new method to calc the next number that should be inserted.
2.	the servlet that creates SolutionItem, does not have to give in the ctor the "number to insert" anymore.
	till now it gave already 1, but if 1 is filled, i got stuck. so i removed it from the ctor, and before
	i put the first (the input) puzzle on the stuck, i calc the next number that should be inserted.
	As a result of "cleaning" the ctor, it helped me getting rid of the "NA" (-1) constant that i had 
	to create when i create a new SolutionItem in insertNumberToPuzzle().  
3.	BUGFIX: after inserting a number, if "it is not finished", then instead of putting y=0, i put there
	y=-1, becoz after popping, i increment, so i have to put y=-1 so after the inc i will start from 0.
